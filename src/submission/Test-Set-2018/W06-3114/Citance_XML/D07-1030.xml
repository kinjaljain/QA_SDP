			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Within the Machine Translation (MT) field, by far the most dominant paradigm is SMT, but many existing commercial systems are rule-based.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">In this research, we are interested in answering the ques tion of whether the existing RBMT systems could be helpful to the development of an SMT system.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">To find the answer, let us first consider the follow ing facts: ? Existing RBMT systems are usually pro vided as a black box.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">To make use of such systems, the most convenient way might be working on the translation results di rectly.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">SMT methods rely on bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">As a data driven method, SMT usually needs large bilingual corpus as the training data.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Based on the above facts, in this paper we pro pose a method using the existing RBMT system as a black box to produce a synthetic bilingual cor pus1, which will be used as the training data for the SMT system.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">For a given language pair, the monolingual cor pus is usually much larger than the real bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">We use the existing RBMT system to translate the monolingual corpus into synthetic bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">Then, even if there is no real bi lingual corpus, we can train an SMT system with the monolingual corpus and the synthetic bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">If there exist n available RBMT systems for the desired language pair, we use the n systems to produce n synthetic bilingual corpora, and n translation models are trained with the n corpora respectively.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">We name such a model the synthetic model.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">An interpolated translation model is built by linear interpolating the n synthetic models.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">In our experiments using BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) as the metric, the interpolated synthetic model achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the syn thetic bilingual corpora.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">1 In this paper, to be distinguished from the real bilingual cor-.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">pus, the bilingual corpus generated by the RBMT system is called a synthetic bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">287 Moreover, if a real bilingual corpus is available for the desired language pair, we build another translation model, which is named the standard model.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">Then we can build an interpolated model by interpolating the standard model and the syn thetic models.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">Experimental results show that the interpolated model achieves an absolute improve ment of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the standard model.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">The remainder of this paper is organized as fol lows.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="27">In section 2 we summarize the related work.</S>

	<SECTION title="Related Work. " number="2">
			<S sid="32" ssid="1">In the MT field, by far the most dominant paradigm is SMT.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="2">SMT has evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al, 1993) into phrase-based approaches (Koehn et al, 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based approaches (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al, 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Chiang, 2005).</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="3">On the other hand, much important work continues to be carried out in Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) (Carl et al, 2005; Way and Gough, 2005), and many existing commercial systems are rule-based.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="4">Although we are not aware of any previous at tempt to use an existing RBMT system as a black box to produce synthetic bilingual training corpus for general purpose SMT systems, there exists a great deal of work on MT hybrids and Multi Engine Machine Translation (MEMT).</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="5">Research into MT hybrids has increased over the last few years.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="6">Some research focused on the hy brid of various corpus-based MT methods, such as SMT and EBMT (Vogel and Ney, 2000; Marcu, 2001; Groves and Way, 2006; Menezes and Quirk, 2005).</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="7">Others tried to exploit the advantages of both rule-based and corpus-based methods.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="8">Habash et al (2006) built an Arabic-English generationheavy MT system and boosted it with SMT com ponents.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="9">METIS-II is a hybrid machine translation system, in which insights from SMT, EBMT, and RBMT are used (Vandeghinste et al, 2006).</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="10">Seneff et al (2006) combined an interlingual translation framework with phrase-based SMT for spoken language translation in a limited domain.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="11">They automatically generated a corpus of EnglishChinese pairs from the same interlingual representation by parsing the English corpus and then paraphrasing each utterance into both English and Chi nese.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="12">Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) produced the first MEMT system by combining outputs from three different MT engines based on their knowl edge of the inner workings of the engines.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="13">Nomoto (2004) used voted language models to select the best output string at sentence level.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="14">Some recent approaches to MEMT used word alignment tech niques for comparison between the MT systems (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Zaanen and Somers, 2005; Matusov et al 2006).</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="15">All the above MEMT systems operate on MT outputs for complete input sentences.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="16">Mellebeek et al (2006) presented a dif ferent approach, using a recursive decomposition algorithm that produces simple chunks as input to the MT engines.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="17">A consensus translation is pro duced by combining the best chunk translation.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="18">This paper uses RBMT outputs to improve the performance of SMT systems.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="19">Instead of RBMT outputs, other researchers have used SMT outputs to boost translation quality.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="20">Callision-Burch and Osborne (2003) used co-training to extend existing parallel corpora, wherein machine translations are selectively added to training corpora with multiple source texts.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="21">They also created training data for a language pair without a parallel corpus by using multiple source texts.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="22">Ueffing (2006) explored monolingual source-language data to improve an existing machine translation system via self training.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="23">The source data is translated by a SMT system, and the reliable translations are automati cally identified.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="24">Both of the methods improved translation quality.</S>

			<S sid="210" ssid="1">6.1 Model Interpolation vs. Corpus Merge.</S>
			<S sid="211" ssid="2">In section 5, we make use of the real bilingual corpus and the synthetic bilingual corpora by perform ing model interpolation.</S>
			<S sid="212" ssid="3">Another available way is directly combining these two kinds of corpora to train a translation model, namely corpus merge.</S>
			<S sid="213" ssid="4">In order to compare these two methods, we use RBMT system 1 to translate the 1,087,651 monolingual English sentences to produce synthetic bi lingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="214" ssid="5">Then we train an SMT system with the combination of this synthetic bilingual corpus and the real bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="215" ssid="6">The BLEU score of such system is 0.1887, while that of the model in terpolation system is 0.2020.</S>
			<S sid="216" ssid="7">It indicates that the model interpolation method is significantly better than the corpus merge method.</S>
			<S sid="217" ssid="8">6.2 Result Analysis.</S>
			<S sid="218" ssid="9">As discussed in Section 5.5, the number of the overlapped phrase pairs among the standard model and the synthetic models is very small.</S>
			<S sid="219" ssid="10">The newly added phrase pairs from the synthetic models can assist to improve the translation results of the in terpolated model.</S>
			<S sid="220" ssid="11">In this section, we will use an example to further discuss the reason behind the improvement of the SMT system by using syn thetic bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="221" ssid="12">Table 5 shows an English sentence and its Chinese translations produced by different methods.</S>
			<S sid="222" ssid="13">And Figure 3 shows the phrase pairs used for translation.</S>
			<S sid="223" ssid="14">The results show that imperfect translations of RBMT systems can be also used to boost the performance of an SMT sys tem.</S>
			<S sid="224" ssid="15">Phrase Pairs Phrase Pairs Used New Pairs Used Standard Model 6,105,260 5,509 ? Interpolated Model 73,221,525 5,306 1993 Table 6.</S>
			<S sid="225" ssid="16">Statistics of Phrase Pairs Further analysis is shown in Table 6.</S>
			<S sid="226" ssid="17">After add ing the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT systems, the interpolated model outperforms the standard models mainly for the following two rea sons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added into the interpolated model.</S>
			<S sid="227" ssid="18">37.6% phrase pairs (1993 out of 5306) are newly learned and used for translation.</S>
			<S sid="228" ssid="19">For example, the phrase pair "after-sale service &lt;-&gt; ????</S>
			<S sid="229" ssid="20">(shouhoufuwu)" is added; (2) The prob ability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed.</S>
			<S sid="230" ssid="21">For example, the probabilities of the two pairs "a brand name &lt;-&gt; ??</S>
			<S sid="231" ssid="22">(pinpai)" and "and the crea tion of &lt;-&gt; ? ??</S>
			<S sid="232" ssid="23">(he chuangzao)" increase.</S>
			<S sid="233" ssid="24">The probabilities of the other two pairs "brand name &lt; &gt; ??</S>
			<S sid="234" ssid="25">(pinpai)" and "and the creation of a &lt;-&gt; ? ??</S>
			<S sid="235" ssid="26">(he jianli)" decrease.</S>
			<S sid="236" ssid="27">We found that 930 phrase pairs, which are also in the phrase table of the standard model, are used by the interpolated model for translation but not used by the standard model.</S>
			<S sid="237" ssid="28">6.3 Human Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="238" ssid="29">According to (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison Burch et al, 2006), the RBMT systems are usually not adequately appreciated by BLEU.</S>
			<S sid="239" ssid="30">We also manually evaluated the RBMT systems and SMT systems in terms of both adequacy and fluency as defined in (Koehn and Monz, 2006).</S>
			<S sid="240" ssid="31">The evalua tion results show that the SMT system with the interpolated model, which achieves the highest BLEU scores in Table 2, achieves slightly better adequacy and fluency scores than the two RBMT systems.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusion and Future Work. " number="7">
			<S sid="241" ssid="1">We presented a method using the existing RBMT system as a black box to produce synthetic bilin gual corpus, which was used as training data for the SMT system.</S>
			<S sid="242" ssid="2">We used the existing RBMT system to translate the monolingual corpus into a syn thetic bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="243" ssid="3">With the synthetic bilingual corpus, we could build an SMT system even if there is no real bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="244" ssid="4">In our experi ments using BLEU as the metric, such a system achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the syn thetic bilingual corpora.</S>
			<S sid="245" ssid="5">It indicates that using the existing RBMT systems to produce a synthetic bi lingual corpus, we can build an SMT system that outperforms the existing RBMT systems.</S>
			<S sid="246" ssid="6">We also interpolated the model trained on a real bilingual corpus and the models trained on the syn thetic bilingual corpora, the interpolated model achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the individual model trained on the real bilingual cor 293 pus.</S>
			<S sid="247" ssid="7">It indicates that we can build a better SMT system by leveraging the real and the synthetic bi lingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="248" ssid="8">Further result analysis shows that after adding the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT systems, the interpolated model outperforms the stan dard models mainly because of two reasons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added to the interpo lated model; (2) the probability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed.</S>
			<S sid="249" ssid="9">In the future work, we will investigate the possi bility of training a reverse SMT system with the RBMT systems.</S>
			<S sid="250" ssid="10">For example, we will investigate to train Chinese-to-English SMT system based on natural English and RBMT-generated synthetic Chinese.</S>
