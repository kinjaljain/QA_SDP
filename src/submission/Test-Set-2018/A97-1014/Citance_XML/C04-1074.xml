	<SECTION title="Introduction" number="1">
			<S sid="5" ssid="5">In recent years, a variety of approaches to pronoun resolution have been proposed.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Some of them are based on centering theory (Strube, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Tetreault, 2001), others on Machine Learning (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ge et al, 1998; Soon et al, 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al, 2003).</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">They supplement older heuristic approaches(Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994).</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">Unfortu nately, most of these approaches were evaluated on different corpora making different assumptions so that direct comparison is not possible.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">Appreciation of the new insights is quite hard.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Evaluation differs not only with regard to size and genre of corpora but also along the following lines.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">Scope of application: Some approaches only deal with personal and possessive pronouns (centering and heuristic), while others consider coreference links in general (Soon et al, 2001; Ng and Cardie,2002; Yang et al, 2003).</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">A drawback of this latter view is that it mixes problems on different lev els of difficulty.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">It remains unclear how much of the success is due to the virtues of the approach and how much is due to the distribution of hard and easy problems in the corpus.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">In this paper, we will only deal with coreferential pronouns (i.e. possessive, demonstrative, and third person pronouns).</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">My thanks go to Melvin Wurster for help in annotation and to Ciprian Gerstenberger for discussion.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">Quality of linguistic input: Some proposals were evaluated on hand annotated (Strube and Hahn, 1999) or tree bank input (Ge et al, 1998; Tetreault, 2001).</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">Other proposals provide a more realistic picture in that they work as a backend to a parser (Lappin and Leass, 1994) or noun chunker (Mitkov, 1998; Soon et al, 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002)).</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">In evaluation of applications presupposing parsing, itis helpful to separate errors due to parsing from in trinsic errors.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">On the other hand, one would alsolike to gauge the end-to-end performance of a sys tem.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">Thus we will provide performance figures forboth ideal (hand-annotated) input and realistic (au tomatically generated) input.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">Language: Most approaches were evaluated on English where large resources are available, both in terms of pre-annotated data (MUC-6 and MUC-7 data) and lexical information (WordNet).</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">This paper deals with German.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">Arguably, the free word-orderof German arguably leads to a clearer distinction between grammatical function, surface order, and in formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999).The paper is organized as follows.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">Section 2 de scribes the evaluation corpus.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">Section 3 describesseveral factors relevant to pronoun resolution.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">It as sesses these factors against the corpus, measuringtheir precision and restrictiveness.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="27">Section 4 de scribes and evaluates six algorithms on the basis ofthese factors.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="28">It also captures the algorithms as parametric systems and proposes parameter settings op timal on the evaluation data.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="29">Section 5 concludes.</S>

	<SECTION title="Evaluation Corpus. " number="2">
			<S sid="30" ssid="1">We chose as an evaluation base the NEGRA treebank, which contains about 350,000 tokens of German newspaper text.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="2">The same corpus was also pro cessed with a finite-state parser, performing at 80% dependency f-score (Schiehlen, 2003).All personal pronouns (PPER), possessive pro nouns (PPOSAT), and demonstrative pronouns (PDS) in Negra were annotated in a format geared to the MUC-7 guidelines (MUC-7, 1997).</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="3">Proper names were annotated automatically by a named entity recognizer.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="4">In a small portion of the corpus (6.7%), all coreference links were annotated.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="5">Thusthe size of the annotated data (3,115 personal pronouns1 , 2,198 possessive pronouns, 928 demonstra tive pronouns) compares favourably with the size ofevaluation data in other proposals (619 German pro nouns in (Strube and Hahn, 1999), 2,477 English pronouns in (Ge et al, 1998), about 5,400 English coreferential expressions in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)).In the experiments, systems only looked for single NP antecedents.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="6">Hence, propositional or predicative antecedents (8.4% of the pronouns annotated) and split antecedents (0.2%) were inaccessi ble, which reduced optimal success rate to 91.4%.</S>

	<SECTION title="Factors in Pronoun Resolution. " number="3">
			<S sid="36" ssid="1">Pronoun resolution is conditioned by a wide range of factors.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="2">Two questions arise: Which factors are the most effective?</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="3">How is interaction of the factors modelled?</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="4">The present section deals with the first question, while the second question is postponed to section 4.Many approaches distinguish two classes of resolution factors: filters and preferences.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="5">Filters ex press linguistic rules, while preferences are merely tendencies in interpretation.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="6">Logically, filters are monotonic inferences that select a certain subsetof possible antecedents, while preferences are nonmonotonic inferences that partition the set of an tecedents and impose an order on the cells.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="7">In the sequel, factors proposed in the literature are discussed and their value is appraised on evaluation data.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="8">Every factor narrows the set of antecedentsand potentially discards correct antecedents.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="9">Table 1 lists both the success rate maximally achiev able (broken down according to different types of pronouns) and the average number of antecedents remaining after applying each factor.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="10">Figures arealso given for parsed input.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="11">Preferences are evalu ated on filtered sets of antecedents.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="12">3.1 Filters.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="13">Agreement.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="14">An important filter comes from morphology: Agreement in gender and number is generally regarded as a prerequisite for coreference.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="15">Exceptions are existant but few (2.5%): abstract pronouns (such as that in English) referring to non neuter or plural NPs, plural pronouns co-referringwith singular collective NPs (Ge et al, 1998), an tecedent and anaphor matching in natural gender 1Here, we only count anaphoric pronouns, i.e. third person pronouns not used expletively.rather than grammatical gender.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="16">All in all, a maximal performance of 88.9% is maintained.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="17">The fil ter is very restrictive, and cuts the set of possible antecedents in half.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="18">See Table 1 for details.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="19">Binding.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="20">Binding constraints have been in the focus of linguistic research for more than thirty years.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="21">They provide restrictions on co-indexation of pronouns with clause siblings, and therefore can only be applied with systems that determine clauseboundaries, i.e. parsers (Mitkov, 1998).</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="22">Empirically, binding constraints are rules without exceptions, hence they do not lead to any loss in achievable performance.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="23">The downside is that their restric tive power is quite bad as well (0.3% in our corpus, cf.</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="24">Table 1).Sortal Constraints.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="25">More controversial are sor tal constraints.</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="26">Intuitively, they also provide a hardfilter: The correct antecedent must fit into the en vironment of the pronoun (Carbonell and Brown, 1988).</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="27">In general, however, the required knowledge sources are lacking, so they must be hand-coded and can only be applied in restricted domains (Strube and Hahn, 1999).</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="28">Selectional restrictions can also be modelled by collocational data extracted by aparser, which have, however, only a very small im pact on overall performance (Kehler et al, 2004).</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="29">We will neglect sortal constraints in this paper.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="30">3.2 Preferences.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="31">Preferences can be classified according to their requirements on linguistic processing.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="32">Sentence Re cency and Surface Order can be read directly off the surface.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="33">NP Form presupposes at least tagging.</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="34">Arange of preferences (Grammatical Roles, Role Par allelism, Depth of Embedding, Common Path), as well as all filters, presuppose full syntactic analysis.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="35">Mention Count and Information Status are based onprevious decisions of the anaphora resolution mod ule.Sentence Recency (SR).</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="36">The most important cri terion in pronoun resolution (Lappin and Leass, 1994) is the textual distance between anaphor andantecedent measured in sentences.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="37">Lappin and Leass (1994) motivate this preference as a dynamic ex pression of the attentional state of the human hearer:Memory capability for storage of discourse refer ents degrades rapidly.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="38">Several implementations are possible.</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="39">Perhaps most obvious is the strategy implicit in Lappin and Leass (1994)?s algorithm: The antecedent issearched in a sentence that is as recent as possi ble, beginning with the already uttered part of the current sentence, continuing in the last sentence, in the one but last sentence, and so forth.</S>
