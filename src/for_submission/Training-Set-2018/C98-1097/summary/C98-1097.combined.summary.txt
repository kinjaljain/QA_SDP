Text Segmentation Using Reiteration and Collocation A method is presented for segmenting text into subtopic areas. The proportion of related pairwise words is calculated between adjacent windows of text to determine their lexical similarity. The lexical cohesion relations of reiteration and collocation are used to identify related words. These relations are automatically located using a combination of three linguistic features: word repetition, collocation and relation weights. This method is shown to successfully detect known subject changes in text and corresponds well to the segmentations placed by test subjects. The paper 'Text Segmentation Using Reiteration and Collocation'  by Amanda C. Jobbins and Lindsay J. Evett presentes a method for segmenting a text into subtopics using Lexical cohesion.Lexical cohesion is expressed through the vocabulary used in text and the semantic relations between those words.For automatic detection of lexical cohesion  ties between pairwise words, three linguistic features were considered: word repetition, collocation and relation weights.The proposed segmentation algorithm compares adjacent windows of sentences and determines their lexical similarity. In first investigation word repetition alone achieved better results than using either collocation or relation weights individually. The combination of word repetition with another linguistic feature improved on its individual result, where less troughs were placed per text.In second investigation, recall rates tended to be lower than precision rates because the algorithm identified fewer segments than the test subjects. Each text was only 500 words in length and was related to a specific subject area.These factors limited the degree of subject change that occurred. Consequently, the test subjects tended to identify subject changes that were more subtle than the algorithm could detect.The combination of features word repetition and relation weights produced the best precision and recall rates of 0.80 and 0.69. When used in isolation, the performance of each feature was inferior to a combined approach. This fact provides evidence that  different lexical relations are detected by each linguistic feature considered. The Wall Street Journal archives, for example, consist of a series of articles about different subject areas. Segmenting such data into distinct topics is useful for information retrieval, where only those segments relevant to a user&apos;s query can be retrieved. Another approach extracted semantic information from Roget&apos;s Thesaurus (RT). Lexical cohesion is expressed through the vocabulary used in text and the semantic relations between those words. Identifying semantic relations in a text can be a useful indicator of its conceptual structure. Reiteration is subdivided into four cohesive effects: word repetition (e.g. ascent and ascent), synonym (e.g. ascent and climb) which includes near-synonym and hyponym, superordinate (e.g. ascent and task) and general word (e.g. ascent and thing). To automatically detect lexical cohesion tics between pairwise words, three linguistic features were considered: word repetition, collocation and relation weights. Word repetition is a component of the lexical cohesion class of reiteration, and collocation is a lexical cohesion class in its entirety. Word repetition: Word repetition ties in lexical cohesion are identified by same word matches and matches on inflections derived from the same stem. The proposed segmentation algorithm compares adjacent windows of sentences and determines their lexical similarity. Both word repetition in combination with collocation and all three features in combination also achieved a precision rate of 0.80 but attained a lower recall rate of 0.62. The combination of features word repetition and relation weights produced the best precision and recall rates of 0.80 and 0.69. When used in isolation, the performance of each feature was inferior to a combined approach. This fact provides evidence that different lexical relations are detected by each linguistic feature considered.
