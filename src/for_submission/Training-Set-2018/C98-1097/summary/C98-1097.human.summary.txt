The paper 'Text Segmentation Using Reiteration and Collocation'  by Amanda C. Jobbins and Lindsay J. Evett presentes a method for segmenting a text into subtopics using Lexical cohesion.Lexical cohesion is expressed through the vocabulary used in text and the semantic relations between those words.For automatic detection of lexical cohesion  ties between pairwise words, three linguistic features were considered: word repetition, collocation and relation weights.The proposed segmentation algorithm compares adjacent windows of sentences and determines their lexical similarity. In first investigation word repetition alone achieved better results than using either collocation or relation weights individually. The combination of word repetition with another linguistic feature improved on its individual result, where less troughs were placed per text.In second investigation, recall rates tended to be lower than precision rates because the algorithm identified fewer segments than the test subjects. Each text was only 500 words in length and was related to a specific subject area.These factors limited the degree of subject change that occurred. Consequently, the test subjects tended to identify subject changes that were more subtle than the algorithm could detect.The combination of features word repetition and relation weights produced the best precision and recall rates of 0.80 and 0.69. When used in isolation, the performance of each feature was inferior to a combined approach. This fact provides evidence that  different lexical relations are detected by each linguistic feature considered.
