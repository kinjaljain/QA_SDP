Each word generated by Gs,τs is annotated with a “sense,” which consists of zero or more words from s. The senses imply an alignment (a) between words in t and words in s, or equivalently, between nodes in τt and nodes in τs. In principle, any portion of τt may align to any portion of τs, but in practice we often make restrictions on the alignments to simplify computation.</S><S ssid=""1"" sid=""2"">The core of the approach is a novel decoder based on lattice parsing with quasi- synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006), a syntactic formalism that does not require source and target trees to be isomorphic.</S>",['methodcitation']
