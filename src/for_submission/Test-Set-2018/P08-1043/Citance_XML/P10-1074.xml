  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="6" ssid="1">Joint learning of multiple types of linguistic structure results in models which produce more consistent outputs, and for which performance improves across all aspects of the joint structure.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="2">Joint models can be particularly useful for producing analyses of sentences which are used as input for higher-level, more semantically-oriented systems, such as question answering and machine translation.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="3">These high-level systems typically combine the outputs from many low-level systems, such as parsing, named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="4">When trained separately, these single-task models can produce outputs which are inconsistent with one another, such as named entities which do not correspond to any nodes in the parse tree (see Figure 1 for an example).</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="5">Moreover, one expects that the different types of annotations should provide useful information to one another, and that modeling them jointly should improve performance.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="6">Because a named entity should correspond to a node in the parse tree, strong evidence about either aspect of the model should positively impact the other aspect.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="7">However, designing joint models which actually improve performance has proven challenging.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="8">The CoNLL 2008 shared task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) was on joint parsing and semantic role labeling, but the best systems (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) were the ones which completely decoupled the tasks.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="9">While negative results are rarely published, this was not the first failed attempt at joint parsing and semantic role labeling (Sutton and McCallum, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="10">There have been some recent successes with joint modeling.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="11">Zhang and Clark (2008) built a perceptron-based joint segmenter and part-of-speech (POS) tagger for Chinese, and Toutanova and Cherry (2009) learned a joint model of lemmatization and POS tagging which outperformed a pipelined model.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="12">Adler and Elhadad (2006) presented an HMMbased approach for unsupervised joint morphological segmentation and tagging of Hebrew, and Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) developed a joint model of segmentation, tagging and parsing of Hebrew, based on lattice parsing.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="13">No discussion of joint modeling would be complete without mention of (Miller et al., 2000), who trained a Collinsstyle generative parser (Collins, 1997) over a syntactic structure augmented with the template entity and template relations annotations for the MUC-7 shared task.</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="14">One significant limitation for many joint models is the lack of jointly annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="15">We built a joint model of parsing and named entity recognition (Finkel and Manning, 2009b), which had small gains on parse performance and moderate gains on named entity performance, when compared with single-task models trained on the same data.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="16">However, the performance of our model, trained using the OntoNotes corpus (Hovy et al., 2006), fell short of separate parsing and named entity models trained on larger corpora, annotated with only one type of information.</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="17">This paper addresses the problem of how to learn high-quality joint models with smaller quantities of jointly-annotated data that has been augmented with larger amounts of single-task annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="18">To our knowledge this work is the first attempt at such a task.</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="19">We use a hierarchical prior to link a joint model trained on jointly-annotated data with other single-task models trained on single-task annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="20">The key to making this work is for the joint model to share some features with each of the single-task models.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="21">Then, the singly-annotated data can be used to influence the feature weights for the shared features in the joint model.</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="22">This is an important contribution, because it provides all the benefits of joint modeling, but without the high cost of jointly annotating large corpora.</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="23">We applied our hierarchical joint model to parsing and named entity recognition, and it reduced errors by over 20% on both tasks when compared to a joint model trained on only the jointly annotated data.</S>

    <S sid="29" ssid="1">Our task can be viewed as an instance of multi-task learning, a machine learning paradigm in which the objective is to simultaneously solve multiple, related tasks for which you have separate labeled training data.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="2">Many schemes for multitask learning, including the one we use here, are instances of hierarchical models.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="3">There has not been much work on multi-task learning in the NLP community; Daum&#180;e III (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2009a) both build models for multi-domain learning, a variant on domain adaptation where there exists labeled training data for all domains and the goal is to improve performance on all of them.</S>

    <S sid="37" ssid="1">In this section we will discuss the main contribution of this paper, our hierarchical joint model which improves joint modeling performance through the use of single-task models which can be trained on singly-annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="2">Our experiments are on a joint parsing and named entity task, but the technique is more general and only requires that the base models (the joint model and single-task models) share some features.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="3">This section covers the general technique, and we will cover the details of the parsing, named entity, and joint models that we use in Section 4.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="4">As discussed, we have a joint model which requires jointly-annotated data, and several singletask models which only require singly-annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="5">The key to our hierarchical model is that the joint model must have features in common with each of the single models, though it can also have features which are only present in the joint model. chical joint model.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="6">There are separate base models for just parsing, just NER, and joint parsing and NER.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="7">The parameters for these models are linked via a hierarchical prior.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="8">Each model has its own set of parameters (feature weights).</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="9">However, parameters for the features which are shared between the single-task models and the joint model are able to influence one another via a hierarchical prior.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="10">This prior encourages the learned weights for the different models to be similar to one another.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="11">After training has been completed, we retain only the joint model&#8217;s parameters.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="12">Our resulting joint model is of higher quality than a comparable joint model trained on only the jointly-annotated data, due to all of the evidence provided by the additional single-task data.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="13">We have a set M of three base models: a parse-only model, an NER-only model and a joint model.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="14">These have corresponding loglikelihood functions Lp(Dp; &#952;p), Ln(Dn; &#952;n), and Lj(Dj; &#952;j), where the Ds are the training data for each model, and the &#952;s are the model-specific parameter (feature weight) vectors.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="15">These likelihood functions do not include priors over the &#952;s.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="16">For representational simplicity, we assume that each of these vectors is the same size and corresponds to the same ordering of features.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="17">Features which don&#8217;t apply to a particular model type (e.g., parse features in the named entity model) will always be zero, so their weights have no impact on that model&#8217;s likelihood function.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="18">Conversely, allowing the presence of those features in models for which they do not apply will not influence their weights in the other models because there will be no evidence about them in the data.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="19">These three models are linked by a hierarchical prior, and their feature weight vectors are all drawn from this prior.</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="20">The parameters &#952;* for this prior have the same dimensionality as the model-specific parameters &#952;m and are drawn from another, top-level prior.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="21">In our case, this top-level prior is a zero-mean Gaussian.1 The graphical representation of our hierarchical model is shown in Figure 2.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="22">The log-likelihood of this model is The first summation in this equation computes the log-likelihood of each model, using the data and parameters which correspond to that model, and the prior likelihood of that model&#8217;s parameters, based on a Gaussian prior centered around the top-level, non-model-specific parameters &#952;*, and with model-specific variance &#963;m.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="23">The final summation in the equation computes the prior likelihood of the top-level parameters &#952;* according to a Gaussian prior with variance &#963;* and mean &#181; (typically zero).</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="24">This formulation encourages each base model to have feature weights similar to the top-level parameters (and hence one another).</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="25">The effects of the variances &#963;m and &#963;* warrant some discussion. &#963;* has the familiar interpretation of dictating how much the model &#8220;cares&#8221; about feature weights diverging from zero (or &#181;).</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="26">The model-specific variances, &#963;m, have an entirely different interpretation.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="27">They dictate how how strong the penalty is for the domain-specific parameters to diverge from one another (via their similarity to &#952;*).</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="28">When &#963;m are very low, then they are encouraged to be very similar, and taken to the extreme this is equivalent to completely tying the parameters between the tasks.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="29">When &#963;m are very high, then there is less encouragement for the parameters to be similar, and taken to the extreme this is equivalent to completely decoupling the tasks.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="30">We need to compute partial derivatives in order to optimize the model parameters.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="31">The partial derivatives for the parameters for each base model m are given by: where the first term is the partial derivative according to the base model, and the second term is 1Though we use a zero-mean Gaussian prior, this toplevel prior could take many forms, including an Ll prior, or another hierarchical prior. the prior centered around the top-level parameters.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="32">The partial derivatives for the top level parameters where the first term relates to how far each modelspecific weight vector is from the top-level parameter values, and the second term relates how far each top-level parameter is from zero.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="33">When a model has strong evidence for a feature, effectively what happens is that it pulls the value of the top-level parameter for that feature closer to the model-specific value for it.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="34">When it has little or no evidence for a feature then it will be pulled in the direction of the top-level parameter for that feature, whose value was influenced by the models which have evidence for that feature. its value and derivatives by the proport ion of the training data used.</S>

    <S sid="72" ssid="36">We now describe the more complicated case of stochastic optimization with a hierarchical objective function.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="37">For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that we are meaning | stochastic gradient descent only makes use of the partial derivatives and not the function value, so we will focus the remainder of the discussion on rescale based on the number of data in that training set, not the total number of data in all the models combined.</S>

    <S sid="75" ssid="39">The first term in that equation is a summation over all the models.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="40">In the stochastic derivative we only perform this computation for the datum&#8217;s model m(d), and then we rescale that value based on the number of data in that datum&#8217;s model |Dm(d)|.</S>

    <S sid="80" ssid="44">L-BFGS and gradient descent, two frequently used numerical optimization algorithms, require computing the value and partial derivatives of the objective function using the entire training set.</S>

    <S sid="91" ssid="1">Our hierarchical joint model is composed of three separate models, one for just named entity recognition, one for just parsing, and one for joint parsing and named entity recognition.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="2">In this section we will review each of these models individually.</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="3">For our named entity recognition model we use a semi-CRF (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004; Andrew, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="4">Semi-CRFs are very similar to the more popular linear-chain CRFs, but with several key advantages.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="5">Semi-CRFs segment and label the text simultaneously, whereas a linear-chain CRF will only label each word, and segmentation is implied by the labels assigned to the words.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="6">When doing named entity recognition, a semi-CRF will have one node for each entity, unlike a regular CRF which will have one node for each word.2 See Figure 3a-b for an example of a semi-CRF and a linear-chain CRF over the same sentence.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="7">Note that the entity Hilary Clinton has one node in the semi-CRF representation, but two nodes in the linear-chain CRF.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="8">Because different segmentations have different model structures in a semiCRF, one has to consider all possible structures (segmentations) as well as all possible labelings.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="9">It is common practice to limit segment length in order to speed up inference, as this allows for the use of a modified version of the forward-backward algorithm.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="10">When segment length is not restricted, the inference procedure is the same as that used in parsing (Finkel and Manning, 2009c).3 In this work we do not enforce a length restriction, and directly utilize the fact that the model can be transformed into a parsing model.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="11">Figure 3c shows a parse tree representation of a semi-CRF.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="12">While a linear-chain CRF allows features over adjacent words, a semi-CRF allows them over adjacent segments.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="13">This means that a semi-CRF can utilize all features used by a linear-chain CRF, and can also utilize features over entire segments, such as First National Bank ofNew York City, instead of just adjacent words like First National and Bank of.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="14">Let y be a vector representing the labeling for an entire sentence. yi encodes the label of the ith segment, along with the span of words the segment encompasses.</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="15">Let 0 be the feature weights, and f(s, yi, yi_1) the feature function over adjacent segments yi and yi_1 in sentence s.4 The log likelihood of a semi-CRF for a single sentence s is given by: The partition function Zs serves as a normalizer.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="16">It requires summing over the set ys of all possible segmentations and labelings for the sentence s: 2Both models will have one node per word for non-entity words.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="17">3While converting a semi-CRF into a parser results in much slower inference than a linear-chain CRF, it is still significantly faster than a treebank parser due to the reduced number of labels.</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="18">4There can also be features over single entities, but these can be encoded in the feature function over adjacent entities, so for notational simplicity we do not include an additional term for them.</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="19">Because we use a tree representation, it is easy to ensure that the features used in the NER model are identical to those in the joint parsing and named entity model, because the joint model (which we will discuss in Section 4.3) is also based on a tree representation where each entity corresponds to a single node in the tree.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="20">Our parsing model is the discriminatively trained, conditional random field-based context-free grammar parser (CRF-CFG) of (Finkel et al., 2008).</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="21">The relationship between a CRF-CFG and a PCFG is analogous to the relationship between a linearchain CRF and a hidden Markov model (HMM) for modeling sequence data.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="22">Let t be a complete parse tree for sentence s, and each local subtree r E t encodes both the rule from the grammar, and the span and split information (e.g NP(7,9) &#8594; JJ(7,8)NN(8,9) which covers the last two words in Figure 1).</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="23">The feature function f(r, s) computes the features, which are defined over a local subtree r and the words of the sentence.</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="24">Let 0 be the vector of feature weights.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="25">The log-likelihood of tree t over sentence s is: To compute the partition function Zs, which serves to normalize the function, we must sum over T(s), the set of all possible parse trees for sentence s. The partition function is given by: We also need to compute the partial derivatives which are used during optimization.</S>
    <S sid="116" ssid="26">Let fi(r, s) be the value of feature i for subtree r over sentence s, and let E&#952;[fi|s] be the expected value of feature i in sentence s, based on the current model parameters 0.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="27">The partial derivatives of 0 are then given by Just like with a linear-chain CRF, this equation will be zero when the feature expectations in the model equal the feature values in the training data.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="28">A variant of the inside-outside algorithm is used to efficiently compute the likelihood and partial derivatives.</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="29">See (Finkel et al., 2008) for details.</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="30">Our base joint model for parsing and named entity recognition is the same as (Finkel and Manning, 2009b), which is also based on the discriminative parser discussed in the previous section.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="31">The parse tree structure is augmented with named entity information; see Figure 4 for an example.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="32">The features in the joint model are designed in a manner that fits well with the hierarchical joint model: some are over just the parse structure, some are over just the named entities, and some are over the joint structure.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="33">The joint model shares the NER and parse features with the respective single-task models.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="34">Features over the joint structure only appear in the joint model, and their weights are only indirectly influenced by the singly-annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="35">In the parsing model, the grammar consists of only the rules observed in the training data.</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="36">In the joint model, the grammar is augmented with addatasets in sentences.</S>

    <S sid="128" ssid="38">Because the grammars are based on the observed data, and the two models have different data, they will have somewhat different grammars.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="39">In our hierarchical joint model, we added all observed rules from the joint data (stripped of named entity information) to the parse-only grammar, and we added all observed rules from the parse-only data to the grammar for the joint model, and augmented them with named entity information in the same manner as the rules observed in the joint data.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="40">Earlier we said that the NER-only model uses identical named entity features as the joint model (and similarly for the parse-only model), but this is not quite true.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="41">They use identical feature templates, such as word, but different realizations of those features will occur with the different datasets.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="42">For instance, the NER-only model may have word=Nigel as a feature, but because Nigel never occurs in the joint data, that feature is never manifested and no weight is learned for it.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="43">We deal with this similarly to how we dealt with the grammar: if a named entity feature occurs in either the joint data or the NER-only data, then both models will learn a weight for that feature.</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="44">We do the same thing for the parse features.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="45">This modeling decision gives the joint model access to potentially useful features to which it would not have had access if it were not part of the hierarchical model.5</S>

    <S sid="144" ssid="9">We similarly decided how many iterations to run stochastic gradient descent for (20) based on early development data experiments.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="10">We did not run this experiment on the CNN portion of the data, because the CNN data was already being used as the extra NER data.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="11">As Table 2 shows, the hierarchical model did substantially better than the joint model overall, which is not surprising given the extra data to which it had access.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="12">Looking at the smaller corpora (NBC and MNB) we see the largest gains, with both parse and NER performance improving by about 8% F1.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="13">ABC saw about a 6% gain on both tasks, and VOA saw a 1% gain on both.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="14">Our one negative result is in the PRI portion: parsing improves slightly, but NER performance decreases by almost 2%.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="15">The same experiment on development data resulted in a performance increase, so we are not sure why we saw a decrease here.</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="16">One general trend, which is not surprising, is that the hierarchical model helps the smaller datasets more than the large ones.</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="17">The source of this is twofold: lower baselines are generally easier to improve upon, and the larger corpora had less singlyannotated data to provide improvements, because it was composed of the remaining, smaller, sections of OntoNotes.</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="18">We found it interesting that the gains tended to be similar on both tasks for all datasets, and believe this fact is due to our use of roughly the same amount of singly-annotated data for both parsing and NER.</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="19">One possible conflating factor in these experiments is that of domain drift.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="20">While we tried to get the most similar annotated data available &#8211; data which was annotated by the same annotators, and all of which is broadcast news &#8211; these are still different domains.</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="21">While this is likely to have a negative effect on results, we also believe this scenario to be a more realistic than if it were to also be data drawn from the exact same distribution.</S>

  <SECTION title="6 Conclusion" number="6">
    <S sid="157" ssid="1">In this paper we presented a novel method for improving joint modeling using additional data which has not been labeled with the entire joint structure.</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="2">While conventional wisdom says that adding more training data should always improve performance, this work is the first to our knowledge to incorporate singly-annotated data into a joint model, thereby providing a method for this additional data, which cannot be directly used by the non-hierarchical joint model, to help improve joint modeling performance.</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="3">We built single-task models for the non-jointly labeled data, designing those single-task models so that they have features in common with the joint model, and then linked all of the different single-task and joint models via a hierarchical prior.</S>
    <S sid="160" ssid="4">We performed experiments on joint parsing and named entity recognition, and found that our hierarchical joint model substantially outperformed a joint model which was trained on only the jointly annotated data.</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="5">Future directions for this work include automatically learning the variances, Qm and Q* in the hierarchical model, so that the degree of information sharing between the models is optimized based on the training data available.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="6">We are also interested in ways to modify the objective function to place more emphasis on learning a good joint model, instead of equally weighting the learning of the joint and single-task models.</S>
