  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="5" ssid="1">Tree adjoining grammars [TAG] (Joshi et al., 1969; Joshi et al., 1975) are a mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism that can handle certain nonlocal dependencies (Kuhlmann and Mohl, 2006), which occur in several natural languages.</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="2">A good overview on TAG, their formal properties, their linguistic motivation, and their applications is presented by Joshi and Schabes (1992) and Joshi and Schabes (1997), in which also strong lexicalization is discussed.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="3">In general, lexicalization is the process of transforming a grammar into an equivalent one (potentially expressed in another formalism) such that each production contains a lexical item (or anchor).</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="4">Each production can then be viewed as lexical information on its anchor.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="5">It demonstrates a syntactical construction in which the anchor can occur.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="6">Since a lexical item is a letter of the string alphabet, each production of a lexicalized grammar produces at least one letter of the generated string.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="7">Consequently, lexicalized grammars offer significant parsing benefits (Schabes et al., 1988) as the number of applications of productions (i.e., derivation steps) is clearly bounded by the length of the input string.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="8">In addition, the lexical items in the productions guide the production selection in a derivation, which works especially well in scenarios with large alphabets.1 The GREIBACH normal form (Hopcroft et al., 2001; Blum and Koch, 1999) offers those benefits for context-free grammars [CFG], but it changes the parse trees.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="9">Thus, we distinguish between two notions of equivalence: Weak equivalence (Bar-Hillel et al., 1960) only requires that the generated string languages coincide, whereas strong equivalence (Chomsky, 1963) requires that even the generated tree languages coincide.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="10">Correspondingly, we obtain weak and strong lexicalization based on the required equivalence.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="11">The GREIBACH normal form shows that CFG can weakly lexicalize themselves, but they cannot strongly lexicalize themselves (Schabes, 1990).</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="12">It is a prominent feature of tree adjoining grammars that they can strongly lexicalize CFG (Schabes, 1990),2 and it was claimed and widely believed that they can strongly lexicalize themselves.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="13">Recently, Kuhlmann and Satta (2012) proved that TAG actually cannot strongly lexicalize themselves.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="14">In fact, they prove that TAG cannot even strongly lexicalize the weaker tree insertion grammars (Schabes and Waters, 1995).</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="15">However, TAG can weakly lexicalize themselves (Fujiyoshi, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="16">Simple (i.e., linear and nondeleting) context-free tree grammars [CFTG] (Rounds, 1969; Rounds, 1970) are a more powerful grammar formalism than TAG (M&#168;onnich, 1997).</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="17">However, the monadic variant is strongly equivalent to a slightly extended version of TAG, which is called non-strict TAG (Kepser and Rogers, 2011).</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="18">A GREIBACH normal form for a superclass of CFTG (viz., second-order abstract categorial grammars) was discussed by Kanazawa and Yoshinaka (2005) and Yoshinaka (2006).</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="19">In particular, they also demonstrate that monadic CFTG can strongly lexicalize regular tree grammars (G&#180;ecseg and Steinby, 1984; G&#180;ecseg and Steinby, 1997).</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="20">CFTG are weakly equivalent to the simple macro grammars of Fischer (1968), which are a notational variant of the well-nested linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) of Vijay-Shanker et al. (1987) and the well-nested multiple context-free grammars (MCFG) of Seki et al.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="21">(1991).3 Thus, CFTG are mildly context-sensitive since their generated string languages are semi-linear and can be parsed in polynomial time (G&#180;omez-Rodr&#180;&#305;guez et al., 2010).</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="22">In this contribution, we show that CFTG can strongly lexicalize TAG and also themselves, thus answering the second question in the conclusion of Kuhlmann and Satta (2012).</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="23">This is achieved by a series of normalization steps (see Section 4) and a final lexicalization step (see Section 5), in which a lexical item is guessed for each production that does not already contain one.</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="24">This item is then transported in an additional argument until it is exchanged for the same item in a terminal production.</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="25">The lexicalization is effective and increases the maximal rank (number of arguments) of the nonterminals by at most 1.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="26">In contrast to a transformation into GREIBACH normal form, our lexicalization does not radically change the structure of the derivations.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="27">Overall, our result shows that if we consider only lexicalization, then CFTG are a more natural generalization of CFG than TAG.</S>

    <S sid="53" ssid="1">In this section, we recall linear and nondeleting context-free tree grammars [CFTG] (Rounds, 1969; Rounds, 1970).</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="2">The property &#8216;linear and nondeleting&#8217; is often called &#8216;simple&#8217;.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="3">The nonterminals of regular tree grammars only occur at the leaves and are replaced using first-order substitution.</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="4">In contrast, the nonterminals of a CFTG are ranked symbols, can occur anywhere in a tree, and are replaced using second-order substitution.6 Consequently, the nonterminals N of a CFTG form a ranked alphabet.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="5">In the left-hand sides of productions we write A(x1, ... , xk) for a nonterminal A E Nk to indicate the variables that hold the direct subtrees of a particular occurrence of A.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="6">The components f and r are called left- and righthand side of the production f &#8212;* r in P. We say that it is an A-production if f = A(x1, ... , xk).</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="7">The right-hand side is simply a tree using terminal and nonterminal symbols according to their rank.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="8">Moreover, it contains all the variables of Xk exactly once.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="9">Let us illustrate the syntax on an example CFTG.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="10">We use an abstract language for simplicity and clarity.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="11">We use lower-case Greek letters for terminal symbols and upper-case Latin letters for nonterminals.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="12">Example 2.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="13">As a running example, we consider the CFTG Gex = ({S(0), A(2)}, E, S, P) where We recall the (term) rewrite semantics (Baader and Nipkow, 1998) of the CFTG G = (N, E, S, P).</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="14">Since G is simple, the actual rewriting strategy is irrelevant.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="15">The sentential forms of G are simply SF(G) = TNU&#931;(X).</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="16">This is slightly more general than necessary (for the semantics of G), but the presence of variables in sentential forms will be useful in the next section because it allows us to treat right-hand sides as sentential forms.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="17">In essence in a rewrite step we just select a nonterminal A E N and an A-production p E P. Then we replace an occurrence of A in the sentential form by the right-hand side of p using second-order substitution.</S>

    <S sid="81" ssid="1">In this section, we first recall an existing normal form for CFTG.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="2">Then we introduce the property of finite ambiguity in the spirit of (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2012), which allows us to normalize our CFTG even further.</S>

    <S sid="84" ssid="4">From now on, let G = (N, E, S, P) be the considered CFTG.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="5">The CFTG G is start-separated if posS(r) = &#8709; for every production ` &#8594; r &#8712; P. In other words, the start nonterminal S is not allowed in the right-hand sides of the productions.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="6">It is clear that each CFTG can be transformed into an equivalent start-separated CFTG.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="7">In such a CFTG we call each production of the form S &#8594; r initial.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="8">From now on, we assume, without loss of generality, that G is start-separated.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="9">Example 5.</S>

    <S sid="92" ssid="12">We start with the growing normal form of Stamer and Otto (2007) and Stamer (2009).</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="13">It requires that the right-hand side of each non-initial production contains at least two terminal or nonterminal symbols.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="14">In particular, it eliminates projection productions A(x1) &#8594; x1 and unit productions, in which the right-hand side has the same shape as the lefthand side (potentially with a different root symbol and a different order of the variables).</S>

    <S sid="104" ssid="24">We obtain the CFTG G''ex = ({S'(0), S(0), A(2)}, E, S', P'') where P'' contains S' &#8594; S and for each &#948; &#8712; {&#945;, &#946;} From now on, we assume that G is growing.</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="25">Next, we recall the notion of finite ambiguity from (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2012).11 We distinguish a subset A &#8838; E0 of lexical symbols, which are the symbols that are preserved by the yield mapping.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="26">The yield of a tree is 11It should not be confused with the notion of &#8216;finite ambiguity&#8217; of (Goldstine et al., 1992; Klimann et al., 2004). a string of lexical symbols.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="27">All other symbols are simply dropped (in a pre-order traversal).</S>

    <S sid="111" ssid="31">Our example CFTG Gex is such that QGex&#65533; has finite {&#945;,&#946;}-ambiguity (because E1 = &#8709;).</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="32">In this contribution, we want to (strongly) lexicalize CFTG, which means that for each CFTG G such that QG&#65533; has finite A-ambiguity, we want to construct an equivalent CFTG such that each non-initial production contains at least one lexical symbol.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="33">This is typically called strong lexicalization (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2012) because we require strong equivalence.12 Let us formalize our lexicalization property.</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="34">Definition 10.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="35">The production ` &#8594; r is A-lexicalized if pos&#916;(r) =6 &#8709;.</S>
    <S sid="116" ssid="36">The CFTG G is A-lexicalized if all its non-initial productions are A-lexicalized.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="37">Note that the CFTG G''ex of Example 8 is not yet {&#945;, &#946;}-lexicalized.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="38">We will lexicalize it in the next section.</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="39">To do this in general, we need some auxiliary normal forms.</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="40">First, we define our simple production elimination scheme, which we will use in the following.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="41">Roughly speaking, a non-initial Aproduction such that A does not occur in its righthand side can be eliminated from G by applying it in 12The corresponding notion for weak equivalence is called weak lexicalization (Joshi and Schabes, 1992). all possible ways to occurrences in right-hand sides of the remaining productions.</S>

    <S sid="125" ssid="45">We obtained the CFTG G''ex of Example 8 as Elim(G'ex, A(x1, x2) &#8594; &#963;(x1, x2)) from G'ex of Example 5.</S>

    <S sid="128" ssid="48">Proof.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="49">Clearly, every single derivation step of G'&#961; can be simulated by a derivation of G using potentially several steps.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="50">Conversely, a derivation of G can be simulated directly by G'&#961; except for derivation steps &#8658;&#961;,p G using the eliminated production &#961;.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="51">Since S =6 A, we know that the nonterminal at position p was generated by another production &#961;'.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="52">In the given derivation of G we examine which nonterminals in the right-hand side of the instance of &#961;' were replaced using &#961;.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="53">Let J be the set of positions corresponding to those nonterminals (thus p &#8712; J).</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="54">Then instead of applying &#961;' and potentially several times &#961;, we equivalently apply &#961;'J of G'&#961;.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="55">In the next normalization step we use our production elimination scheme.</S>
    <S sid="136" ssid="56">The goal is to make sure that non-initial monic productions (i.e., productions of which the right-hand side contains at most one nonterminal) contain at least one lexical symbol.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="57">We define the relevant property and then present the construction.</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="58">A sentential form &#958; &#8712; SF(G) is monic if |posN(&#958;) |&#8804; 1.</S>

    <S sid="150" ssid="70">Moreover, no sentential form in &#176;A contains A for the same reason and the fact that G is growing.</S>

    <S sid="154" ssid="74">It is easy to see that G is growing, startseparated, and equivalent to G2.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="75">The CFTG G00ex only has {&#945;, &#946;}-lexicalized noninitial monic productions, so we use a new example.</S>

  <SECTION title="5 Lexicalization" number="5">
    <S sid="176" ssid="1">In this section, we present the main lexicalization step, which lexicalizes non-monic productions.</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="2">We assume that QG&#65533; has finite &#916;-ambiguity and is normalized according to the results of Section 4: no useless nonterminals, start-separated, growing (see Theorem 7), non-initial monic productions are &#916;lexicalized (see Theorem 13), and non-initial terminal productions contain at least two occurrences of &#916;-symbols (see Theorem 15).</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="3">The basic idea of the construction is that we guess a lexical symbol for each non-&#916;-lexicalized production.</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="4">The guessed symbol is put into a new parameter of a nonterminal.</S>
    <S sid="180" ssid="5">It will be kept in the parameter until we reach a terminal production, where we exchange the same lexical symbol by the parameter.</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="6">This is the reason why we made sure that we have two occurrences of lexical symbols in the terminal productions.</S>
    <S sid="182" ssid="7">After we exchanged one for a parameter, the resulting terminal production is still &#916;-lexicalized.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="8">Lexical items that are guessed for distinct (occurrences of) productions are transported to distinct (occurrences of) terminal productions [cf.</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="9">Section 3 of (Potthoff and Thomas, 1993) and page 346 of (Hoogeboom and ten Pas, 1997)].</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="10">Theorem 17.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="11">For every CFTG G such that QG&#65533; has finite &#916;-ambiguity there exists an equivalent &#916;-lexicalized CFTG.</S>
    <S sid="187" ssid="12">Proof.</S>
    <S sid="188" ssid="13">We can assume that G = (N, &#931;, S, P) has the properties mentioned before the theorem without loss of generality.</S>
    <S sid="189" ssid="14">We let N' = N x &#916; be a new set of nonterminals such that rk((A, &#948;)) = rk(A) + 1 for every A E N and &#948; E &#916;.</S>
    <S sid="190" ssid="15">Intuitively, (A, &#948;) represents the nonterminal A, which has the lexical symbol &#948; in its last (new) parameter.</S>
    <S sid="191" ssid="16">This parameter is handed to the (lexicographically) first nonterminal in the right-hand side until it is resolved in a terminal production.</S>
    <S sid="192" ssid="17">Formally, for each right-hand side r E TNUNIUE(X) such that posN(r) =&#65533; 0 (i.e., it contains an original nonterminal), each k E ICY, and each &#948; E &#916;, let rg,k and rg be such that where p is the lexicographically smallest element of posN(r) and r|p = B(r1, ... , rn) with B E N and r1, ... , rn E TNUNIUE(X).</S>
    <S sid="193" ssid="18">For each nonterminal A-production &#961; = ` &#8212;* r in P let &#961;g = (A, &#948;)(x1, ... , xk+1) &#8212;* rg,k , where k = rk(A).</S>
    <S sid="194" ssid="19">This construction is illustrated in Figure 6.</S>
    <S sid="195" ssid="20">Roughly speaking, we select the lexicographically smallest occurrence of a nonterminal in the right-hand side and pass the lexical symbol &#948; in the extra parameter to it.</S>
    <S sid="196" ssid="21">The extra parameter is used in terminal productions, so let &#961; = ` &#8212;* r in P be a terminal /A-production.</S>
    <S sid="197" ssid="22">Then we define &#961; = hA, r(p)i (x1, ... , xk+1) &#8594; r[xk+1lP , where p is the lexicographically smallest element of pos&#916;(r) and k = rk(A).</S>
    <S sid="198" ssid="23">This construction is illustrated in Figure 7.</S>
    <S sid="199" ssid="24">With these productions we obtain the CFTG G0 = (N &#8746; N0, E, S, P), where It is easy to prove that those new productions manage the desired transport of the extra parameter if it holds the value indicated in the nonterminal.</S>
    <S sid="200" ssid="25">Finally, we replace each non-initial non-A-lexicalized production in G0 by new productions that guess a lexical symbol and add it to the new parameter of the (lexicographically) first nonterminal of N in the right-hand side.</S>
    <S sid="201" ssid="26">Formally, we let of which P000 is added to the productions.</S>
    <S sid="202" ssid="27">Note that each production ` &#8594; r &#8712; Pnil contains at least one occurrence of a nonterminal of N (because all monic productions of G are A-lexicalized).</S>
    <S sid="203" ssid="28">Now all noninitial non-A-lexicalized productions from P can be removed, so we obtain the CFTG G00, which is given by (N &#8746; N0, E, S, R) with R = (P &#8746; P000) \ Pnil.</S>
    <S sid="204" ssid="29">It can be verified that G00 is A-lexicalized and equivalent to G (using the provided argumentation).</S>
    <S sid="205" ssid="30">Instead of taking the lexicographically smallest element of posN(r) or pos&#916;(r) in the previous proof, we can take any fixed element of that set.</S>
    <S sid="206" ssid="31">In the definition of P0 we can change posN(r) =6 &#8709; to |pos&#916;(r) |&#8804; 1, and simultaneously in the definition of P00 change posN(r) = &#8709; to |pos&#916;(r) |&#8805; 2.</S>
    <S sid="207" ssid="32">With the latter changes the guessed lexical item is only transported until it is resolved in a production with at least two lexical items.</S>
    <S sid="208" ssid="33">Example 18.</S>
    <S sid="209" ssid="34">For the last time, we consider the CFTG G00 of Example 8.</S>
    <S sid="210" ssid="35">We already illustrated the ex parts of the construction of Theorem 17 in Figures 6 and 7.</S>
    <S sid="211" ssid="36">The obtained {&#945;, &#946;}-lexicalized CFTG has the following 25 productions for all &#948;, &#948;0 &#8712; {&#945;, &#946;}: where Aa = hA, &#948;i and Sa = hS, &#948;i.</S>
    <S sid="212" ssid="37">If we change the lexicalization construction as indicated before this example, then all the productions Sa(x1) &#8594; Aa(&#948;0, &#948;0, x1) are replaced by the productions Sa(x1) &#8594; A(x1, &#948;).</S>
    <S sid="213" ssid="38">Moreover, the productions (5) can be replaced by the productions A(x1, x2) &#8594; A(&#963;(x1, Sa(&#948;)), &#963;(x2, S)), and then the nonterminals Aa and their productions can be removed, which leaves only 15 productions.</S>

    <S sid="214" ssid="1">For k &#8712; ICY, let CFTG(k) be the set of those CFTG whose nonterminals have rank at most k. Since the normal form constructions preserve the nonterminal rank, the proof of Theorem 17 shows that CFTG(k) are strongly lexicalized by CFTG(k+1).</S>
    <S sid="215" ssid="2">Kepser and Rogers (2011) show that non-strict TAG are strongly equivalent to CFTG(1).</S>
    <S sid="216" ssid="3">Hence, non-strict TAG are strongly lexicalized by CFTG(2).</S>
    <S sid="217" ssid="4">It follows from Section 6 of Engelfriet et al. (1980) that the classes CFTG(k) with k &#8712; ICY induce an infinite hierarchy of string languages, but it remains an open problem whether the rank increase in our lexicalization construction is necessary.</S>
    <S sid="218" ssid="5">G&#180;omez-Rodriguez et al. (2010) show that wellnested LCFRS of maximal fan-out k can be parsed in time O(n2k+2), where n is the length of the input string w &#8712; A&#8727;.</S>
    <S sid="219" ssid="6">From this result we conclude that CFTG(k) can be parsed in time O(n2k+4), in the sense that we can produce a parse tree t that is generated by the CFTG with yd&#916;(t) = w. It is not clear yet whether lexicalized CFTG(k) can be parsed more efficiently in practice.</S>
