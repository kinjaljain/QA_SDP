		<S sid="1" ssid="1">This article is devoted to the problem of quantifying noun groups in German.After a thorough description of the phenom ena, the results of corpus-based in vestigations are described.</S>
		<S sid="2" ssid="2">Moreover,some examples are given that under line the necessity of integrating somekind of information other than gram mar sensu stricto into the treebank.</S>
		<S sid="3" ssid="3">We argue that a more sophisticatedand fine-grained annotation in the tree bank would have very positve effects onstochastic parsers trained on the tree bank and on grammars induced from the treebank, and it would make the treebank more valuable as a source ofdata for theoretical linguistic investigations.</S>
		<S sid="4" ssid="4">The information gained from cor pus research and the analyses that are proposed are realized in the framework of SILVA, a parsing and extraction tool for German text corpora.</S>

			<S sid="5" ssid="5">There is an increasing number of linguists in terested in large syntactically annotated corpora,i.e. so-called treebanks.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Treebanks consist of language samples annotated with structural infor mation - centrally, the grammatical structure ofthe samples, though some resources include cat egories of information other than grammar sensu stricto.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Data contained in treebanks are useful fordiverse theoretical and practical purposes: Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the develop ment of new, efficient and robust natural language processing methods.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">Real-world texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can serve as training and test material for stochastic approaches to natural language processing.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">At the same time, treebanks are a valuable source of datafor theoretical linguistic investigations about lan guage use.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">The data-drivenness of this approach presents a clear advantage over the traditional, idealised notion of competence grammar.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">According to Skut et al (1997) treebanks have to meet the following requirements: 1.</S>
