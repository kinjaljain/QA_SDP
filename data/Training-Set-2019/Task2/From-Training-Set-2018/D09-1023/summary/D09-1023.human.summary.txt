This paper describes Gimpel and Smith’s novel decoder. It is based on efficient DP-based QG lattice parsing extended to handle â€œnon-localâ€ features using generic techniques that also support efficient parameter estimation. They used one feature for each of the configurations in (Smith and Eisner, 2006), adding 7 additional features and presented a machine translation framework that could incorporate arbitrary features of both input and output sentences. Their findings showed that phrase features and dependency syntax produce complementary improvements to translation quality, that tree-to- tree configurations were helpful for translation, and that substantial gains could be obtained by permitting certain types of non- isomorphism. Their decoding framework allowed them to perform many experiments with the same feature representation and inference algorithms, including combining and comparing phrase-based and syntax-based features and examining how isomorphism constraints of synchronous formalisms affect translation output. They used the decoder to conduct controlled experiments on a German-to-English translation task, to compare lexical phrase, syntax, and combined models, and to measure effects of various restrictions on non-isomorphism.
