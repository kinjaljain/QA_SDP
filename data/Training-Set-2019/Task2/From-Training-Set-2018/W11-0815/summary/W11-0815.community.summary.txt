The extensive use of Multiword Expressions (MWE) in natural language texts prompts more detailed studies that aim for a more adequate treatment of these expressions. The automatic discovery of specific types of MWEs has attracted the attention of many researchers in NLP over the past years. One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. This task aimed to explore the contribution of the disambiguation of words to bilingual or monolingual IR. In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Although language processing is not vital to modern IR systems, it may be convenient (Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP techniques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for indexing as single units in the IR system. The selection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor for the quality of IR systems. For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would 101 Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World (MWE 2011), pages 101â€“109, Portland, Oregon, USA, 23 June 2011. We used Zettair to generate the ranked list of documents retrieved in response to each query. This work consists in investigating the impact of Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems, and whether a more adequate treatment for these expressions can bring possible improvements in the indexing these expressions.
