The author in this paper presents Espresso, a novel bootstrapping algorithm for automatically harvesting semantic relations, aiming at effectively supporting NLP applications, emphasizing two major points that have been partially neglected by previous systems: generality and weak supervision. Most researches on lexical relation harvesting has focused on is-a and part-of relations. Approaches fall into two main categories: pattern- and clustering-based. Seed instances are used to infer linguistic patterns that, in turn, are used to extract new instances, ranked according to various statistical measures. Terms are commonly defined as surface representations of stable and key domain concepts. Defining regular expressions over POS-tagged corpora is the most commonly used technique to both define and extract terms. For our preliminary evaluation, the author consider the standard is-a and part-of relations as well as three novel relations i.e. succession, reaction and production. Preliminary results show that Espresso generates highly precise relations, but at the expense of lower recall. The authors are working on improving system recall with a web-based method to identify generic patterns and filter their instances. Early results appear very promising. The authors also plan to investigate the use of WordNet selectional constraints. The authors expect here that negative instances will play a key role in determining the selectional restriction on generic patterns.
