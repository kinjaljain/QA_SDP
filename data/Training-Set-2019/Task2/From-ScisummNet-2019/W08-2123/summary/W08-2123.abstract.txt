This paper presents our contribution in the closed track of the 2008 CoNLL Shared Task (Surdeanu et al., 2008).
To tackle the problem of joint syntactic-semantic analysis, the system relies on a syntactic and a semantic subcomponent.
The syntactic model is a bottom-up projective parser using pseudo-projective transformations, and the semantic model uses global inference mechanisms on top of a pipeline of classifiers.
The complete syntactic-semantic output is selected from a candidate pool generated by the subsystems. 
The system achieved the top score in the closed challenge: a labeled syntactic accuracy of 89.32%, a labeled semantic F1 of 81.65, and a labeled macro F1 of 85.49.
