We present an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger based on a hidden Markov model.
The methodology enables robust and accurate tagging with few resource requirements.
Only a lexicon and some unlabeled training text are required.
Accuracy exceeds 96%.
We describe implementation strategies and optimizations which result in high-speed operation.
Three applications for tagging are described: phrase recognition; word sense disambiguation; and grammatical function assignment.
