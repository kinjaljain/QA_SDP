Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) is a model where no abstract rules, but language experiences in the form of an analyzed corpus, constitute the basis for language processing.
Analyzing a new input means that the system attempts to find find the most probable way to reconstruct the input out of fragments that already exist in the corpus.
Disambiguation occurs as a side-effect.
DOP can be implemented by using conventional parsing strategies.
