This paper presents an on-going project intended to enhance WordNet morphologically and semantically.
The motivation for this work steams from the current limitations of WordNet when used as a linguistic knowledge base.
We envision a software tool that automatically parses the conceptual defining glosses, attributing part-of-speech tags and phrasal brackets.
The nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from every definition are then disambiguated and linked to the corresponding synsets.
This increases the connectivity between synsets allowing the retrieval of topically related concepts.
Furthermore, the tool transforms the glosses, first into logical forms and then into semantic forms.
Using derivational morphology new links are added between the synsets.
