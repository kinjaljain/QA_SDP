I propose a model for determining the hearer's attentional state which depends solely on a list of salient discourse entities (S-list).
The ordering among the elements of the S-list covers also the function of the backward-looking center in the centering model.
The ranking criteria for the S-list are based on the distinction between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities and incorporate preferences for inter- and intra-sentential anaphora.
The model is the basis for an algorithm which operates incrementally, word by word.
