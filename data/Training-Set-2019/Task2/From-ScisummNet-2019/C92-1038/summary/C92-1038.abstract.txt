We simplify previous work in the development of algorithms for the generation of referring expressions while at the same time taking account of psycholinguistic findings and transcript data.
The result is a straightforward algorithm that is computationally tractable, sensitive to the preferences of human users, and reasonably domain-independent.
We provide a specification of the resources a host system must provide in order to make use of the algorithm, and describe an implementation used in the IDAS system.
