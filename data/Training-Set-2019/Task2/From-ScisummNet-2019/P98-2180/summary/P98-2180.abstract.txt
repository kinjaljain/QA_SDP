As a lexical knowledge base constructed automatically from the definitions and example sentences in two machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), MindNet embodies several features that distinguish it from prior work with MRDs.
It is, however, more than this static resource alone.
MindNet represents a general methodology for acquiring, structuring, accessing, and exploiting semantic information from natural language text.
