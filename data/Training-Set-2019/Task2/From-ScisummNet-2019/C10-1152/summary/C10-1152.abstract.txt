In this paper, we consider sentence simplification as a special form of translation with the complex sentence as the source and the simple sentence as the target.
We propose a Tree-based Simplification Model (TSM), which, to our knowledge, is the first statistical simplification model covering splitting, dropping, reordering and substitution integrally. 
We also describe an efficient method to train our model with a large-scale parallel dataset obtained from the Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia.
The evaluation shows that our model achieves better readability scores than a set of baseline systems.
