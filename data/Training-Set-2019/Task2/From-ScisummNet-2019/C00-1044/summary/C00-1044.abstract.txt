Subjectivity is a pragmatic, sentence-level feature that has important implications for text processing applications such as information extraction and information retrieval.
We study the effects of dynamic adjectives, semantically oriented adjectives, and gradable adjectives on a simple subjectivity classifier, and establish that they are strong predictors of subjectivity.
A novel trainable method that statistically combines two indicators of gradability is presented and evaluated, complementing existing automatic techniques for assigning orientation labels.
