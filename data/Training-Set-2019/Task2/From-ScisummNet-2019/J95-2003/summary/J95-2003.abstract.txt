This paper concerns relationships among focus of attention, choice of referring expression, and perceived coherence of utterances within a discourse segment.
It presents a framework and initial theory of centering intended to model the local component of attentional state.
The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state.
It demonstrates that the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.
