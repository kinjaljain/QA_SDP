We present an approach to semantic role labeling (SRL) that takes the output of multiple argument classifiers and combines them into a coherent predicate-argument output by solving an optimization problem.
The optimization stage, which is solved via integer linear programming, takes into account both the recommendation of the classifiers and a set of problem specific constraints, and is thus used both to clean the classification results and to ensure structural integrity of the final role labeling.
We illustrate a significant improvement in overall SRL performance through this inference.
