Traditionally coreference is resolved by satisfying a combination of salience, syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints.
The acquisition of such knowledge is time-consuming, difficult and error-prone.
Therefore, we present a knowledge minimalist methodology of mining coreference rules from annotated text corpora.
Semantic consistency evidence, which is a form of knowledge required by coreference, is easily retrieved from WordNet.
Additional consistency knowledge is discovered by a meta-bootstrapping algorithm applied to unlabeled texts.
