Tempeval-2 comprises evaluation tasks for time expressions, events and temporal relations, the latter of which was split up in four subtasks, motivated by the notion that smaller subtasks would make both data preparation and temporal relation extraction easier.
Manually annotated data were provided for six languages: Chinese, English, French, Italian, Korean and Spanish.
