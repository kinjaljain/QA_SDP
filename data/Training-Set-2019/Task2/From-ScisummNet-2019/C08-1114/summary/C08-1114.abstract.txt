Recognizing analogies, synonyms, antonyms, and associations appear to be four distinct tasks, requiring distinct NLP algorithms.
In the past, the four tasks have been treated independently, using a wide variety of algorithms.
These four semantic classes, however, are a tiny sample of the full range of semantic phenomena, and we cannot afford to create ad hoc algorithms for each semantic phenomenon; we need to seek a unified approach. 
We propose to subsume a broad range of phenomena under analogies. 
To limit the scope of this paper, we restrict our attention to the subsumption of synonyms, antonyms, and associations.
We introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, TOEFL synonym questions, ESL synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both questions from cognitive psychology.
