The TempEval task proposes a simple way to evaluate automatic extraction of temporal relations. 
It avoids the pitfalls of evaluating a graph of inter-related labels by defining three subtasks that allow pairwise evaluation of temporal relations.
The task not only allows straightforward evaluation, it also avoids the complexities of full temporal parsing.
