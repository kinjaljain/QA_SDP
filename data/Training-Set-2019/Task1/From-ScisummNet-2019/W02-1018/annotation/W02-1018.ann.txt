On the basis of this evidence, we expect the system to also learn from sentence pair (S1, T1) that “a” in language S means the same thing as “y” in language T. Unfortunately, if one works with translation models that do not allow Target words to be aligned to more than one Source word — as it is the case in the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) — it is impossible to learn that the phrase “b c” in language S means the same thing as word “x” in language T. The IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), for example, converges to the word alignments shown in Figure 1.b and learns the probabilities shown in Figure Since in the IBM model one cannot link a Target word to more than a Source word, the training procedure train the IBM-4 model, we used Giza (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).</S><S sid = 69 ssid = >Figure 2: Training algorithm for the phrase-based joint probability model.</S> | Discourse Facet:  NA | Annotator: Automatic
