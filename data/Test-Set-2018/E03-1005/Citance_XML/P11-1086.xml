  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="4" ssid="1">Statistical machine translation systems typically model the translation process as a sequence of translation steps, each of which uses a translation rule, for example, a phrase pair in phrase-based translation or a tree-to-string rule in tree-to-string translation.</S>
    <S sid="5" ssid="2">These rules are usually applied independently of each other, which violates the conventional wisdom that translation should be done in context.</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="3">To alleviate this problem, most state-of-the-art systems rely on composed rules, which are larger rules that can be formed out of smaller rules (including larger phrase pairs that can be formerd out of smaller phrase pairs), as opposed to minimal rules, which are rules that cannot be formed out of other rules.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="4">Although this approach does improve translation quality dramatically by weakening the independence assumptions in the translation model, they suffer from two main problems.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="5">First, composition can cause a combinatorial explosion in the number of rules.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="6">To avoid this, ad-hoc limits are placed during composition, like upper bounds on the number of nodes in the composed rule, or the height of the rule.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="7">Under such limits, the grammar size is manageable, but still much larger than the minimal-rule grammar.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="8">Second, due to large grammars, the decoder has to consider many more hypothesis translations, which slows it down.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="9">Nevertheless, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and to our knowledge, all top-performing systems, both phrase-based and syntax-based, use composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="10">For example, Galley et al. (2004) initially built a syntax-based system using only minimal rules, and subsequently reported (Galley et al., 2006) that composing rules improves B by 3.6 points, while increasing grammar size 60-fold and decoding time 15-fold.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="11">The alternative we propose is to replace composed rules with a rule Markov model that generates rules conditioned on their context.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="12">In this work, we restrict a rule&#8217;s context to the vertical chain of ancestors of the rule.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="13">This ancestral context would play the same role as the context formerly provided by rule composition.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="14">The dependency treelet model developed by Quirk and Menezes (2006) takes such an approach within the framework of dependency translation.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="15">However, their study leaves unanswered whether a rule Markov model can take the place of composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="16">In this work, we investigate the use of rule Markov models in the context of treeto-string translation (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., The derivation tree is generated as follows.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="17">With 2006).</S>

    <S sid="25" ssid="22">We carry on until against vertically composed rules, we find that our no more children can be generated.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="23">Thus the probarule Markov model has the same accuracy, but our bility of a derivation tree T is model is much smaller and decoding with our model P(T) = H P(r  |ancn1(r)) (1) is 30% faster.</S>

    <S sid="44" ssid="41">Our results will show that smaller models indeed give a higher B score than the full bigram and trigram models.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="42">The approaches we use are: In this paper, we use our rule Markov model framework in the context of tree-to-string translation.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="43">Tree-to-string translation systems (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) have gained popularity in recent years due to their speed and simplicity.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="44">The input to the translation system is a source parse tree and the output is the target string.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="45">Huang and Mi (2010) have recently introduced an efficient incremental decoding algorithm for tree-to-string translation.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="46">The decoder operates top-down and maintains a derivation history of translation rules encountered.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="47">The history is exactly the vertical chain of ancestors corresponding to the contexts in our rule Markov model.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="48">This makes incremental decoding a natural fit with our generative story.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="49">In this section, we describe how to integrate our rule Markov model into this incremental decoding algorithm.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="50">Note that it is also possible to integrate our rule Markov model with other decoding algorithms, for example, the more common non-incremental top-down/bottom-up approach (Huang et al., 2006), but it would involve a non-trivial change to the decoding algorithms to keep track of the vertical derivation history, which would result in significant overhead.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="51">Algorithm Given the input parse tree in Figure 3, Figure 4 illustrates the search process of the incremental decoder with the grammar of Figure 1.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="52">We write X@&#951; for a tree node with label X at tree address &#951; (Shieber et al., 1995).</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="53">The root node has address &#491;, and the ith child of node &#951; has address &#951;.i.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="54">At each step, the decoder maintains a stack of active rules, which are rules that have not been completed yet, and the rightmost (n &#8722; 1) English words translated thus far (the hypothesis), where n is the order of the word language model (in Figure 4, n = 2).</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="55">The stack together with the translated English words comprise a state of the decoder.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="56">The last column in the figure shows the rule Markov model probabilities with the conditioning context.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="57">In this example, we use a trigram rule Markov model.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="58">After initialization, the process starts at step 1, where we predict rule r1 (the shaded rule) with probability P(r1  |&#491;) and push its English side onto the stack, with variables replaced by the corresponding tree nodes: x1 becomes NP@1 and x2 becomes VP@2.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="59">This gives us the following stack: the English word order.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="60">We expand node NP@1 first with English word order.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="61">We then predict lexical rule r2 with probability P(r2  |r1) and push rule r2 onto the stack: [&#8226; NP@1 VP@2 ] [.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="62">Bush] In step 3, we perform a scan operation, in which we append the English word just after the dot to the current hypothesis and move the dot after the word.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="63">Since the dot is at the end of the top rule in the stack, we perform a complete operation in step 4 where we pop the finished rule at the top of the stack.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="64">In the scan and complete steps, we don&#8217;t need to compute rule probabilities.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="65">An interesting branch occurs after step 10 with two competing lexical rules, r6 and r&#8242;6.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="66">The Chinese word y&#711;u can be translated as either a preposition with (leading to step 11) or a conjunction and (leading to step 11&#8242;).</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="67">The word n-gram model does not have enough information to make the correct choice, with.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="68">As a result, good translations might be pruned because of the beam.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="69">However, our rule Markov model has the correct preference because of the conditioning ancestral sequence (r3, r4), shown in Figure 5.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="70">Since VP@2.2 has a preference for y&#711;u translating to with, our corpus statistics will give a higher probability to P(r6  |r3, r4) than P(r&#8242;6  |r3, r4).</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="71">This helps the decoder to score the correct translation higher.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="72">Complexity analysis With the incremental decoding algorithm, adding rule Markov models does not change the time complexity, which is O(nc|V|g&#8722;1), where n is the sentence length, c is the maximum number of incoming hyperedges for each node in the translation forest, V is the target-language vocabulary, and g is the order of the n-gram language model (Huang and Mi, 2010).</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="73">However, if one were to use rule Markov models with a conventional CKY-style bottom-up decoder (Liu et al., 2006), the complexity would increase to O(nCm&#8722;1|V|4(g&#8722;1)), where C is the maximum number of outgoing hyperedges for each node in the translation forest, and m is the order of the rule Markov model.</S>

  <SECTION title="4.2 Results" number="3">
    <S sid="87" ssid="1">Table 1 presents the main results of our paper.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="2">We used grammars of minimal rules and composed rules of maximum height 3 as our baselines.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="3">For decoding, we used a beam size of 50.</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="4">Using the best bigram rule Markov models and the minimal rule grammar gives us an improvement of 1.5 B over the minimal rule baseline.</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="5">Using the best trigram rule Markov model brings our gain up to 2.3 B . level as composed and vertically composed rules, but is smaller and faster.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="6">The number of parameters is shown for both the full model and the model filtered for the concatenation of the development and test sets (dev+test).</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="7">These gains are statistically significant with p &lt; 0.01, using bootstrap resampling with 1000 samples (Koehn, 2004).</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="8">We find that by just using bigram context, we are able to get at least 1 B point higher than the minimal rule grammar.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="9">It is interesting to see that using just bigram rule interactions can give us a reasonable boost.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="10">We get our highest gains from using trigram context where our best performing rule Markov model gives us 2.3 B points over minimal rules.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="11">This suggests that using longer contexts helps the decoder to find better translations.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="12">We also compared rule Markov models against composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="13">Since our models are currently limited to conditioning on vertical context, the closest comparison is against vertically composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="14">We find that our approach performs equally well using much less time and space.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="15">Comparing against full composed rules, we find that our system matches the score of the baseline composed rule grammar of maximum height 3, while using many fewer parameters.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="16">(It should be noted that a parameter in the rule Markov model is just a floating-point number, whereas a parameter in the composed-rule system is an entire rule; therefore the difference in memory usage would be even greater.)</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="17">Decoding with our model is 0.2 seconds faster per sentence than with composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="18">These experiments clearly show that rule Markov models with minimal rules increase translation quality significantly and with lower memory requirements than composed rules.</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="19">One might wonder if the best performance can be obtained by combining composed rules with a rule Markov model.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="20">This is straightforward to implement: the rule Markov model is still defined over derivations of minimal rules, but in the decoder&#8217;s prediction step, the rule Markov model&#8217;s value on a composed rule is calculated by decomposing it into minimal rules and computing the product of their probabilities.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="21">We find that using our best trigram rule Markov model with composed rules gives us a 0.5 B gain on top of the composed rule grammar, statistically significant with p &lt; 0.05, achieving our highest score of 28.0.1 Tables 2 and 3 show how the various types of rule Markov models compare, for bigrams and trigrams, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="22">It is interesting that the full bigram and trigram rule Markov models do not give our highest B scores; pruning the models not only saves space but improves their performance.</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="23">We think that this is probably due to overfitting.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="24">Table 4 shows that the RM-A trigram model does fairly well under all the settings of Dn we tried.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="25">Table 5 shows the performance of vertically composed rules at various settings.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="26">Here we have chosen the setting that gives the best performance on the test set for inclusion in Table 1.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="27">Table 6 shows the performance offully composed rules and fully composed rules with a rule Markov Model at various settings.2 In the second line (2.9 million rules), the drop in B score resulting from adding the rule Markov model is not statistically significant.</S>

  <SECTION title="6 Conclusion" number="5">
    <S sid="122" ssid="1">In this paper, we have investigated whether we can eliminate composed rules without any loss in translation quality.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="2">We have developed a rule Markov model that captures vertical bigrams and trigrams of minimal rules, and tested it in the framework of treeto-string translation.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="3">We draw three main conclusions from our experiments.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="4">First, our rule Markov models dramatically improve a grammar of minimal rules, giving an improvement of 2.3 B .</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="5">Second, when we compare against vertically composed rules we are able to get about the same B score, but our model is much smaller and decoding with our model is faster.</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="6">Finally, when we compare against full composed rules, we find that we can reach the same level of performance under some conditions, but in order to do so consistently, we believe we need to extend our model to condition on horizontal context in addition to vertical context.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="7">We hope that by modeling context in both axes, we will be able to completely replace composed-rule grammars with smaller minimal-rule grammars.</S>
