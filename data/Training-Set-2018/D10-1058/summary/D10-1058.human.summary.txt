The paper 'A Fast Fertility Hidden Markov Model for Word Alignment Using MCMC ' by Shaojun Zhao and Daniel Gildea proposes a model that adds fertility feature to HMM(Hidden Markov Model).Their model is a combination of HMM and IBM model 4 for achieving less alignment error rate  than HMM and making it easier than IBM model 4.They use Gibbs sampling method than the neighborhood method used in IBM Model 4.They evaluate their model by computing the word alignment error rate (AER) as the word alignment evaluation criterion and machine translation quality.They have evaluated their fertility models on a Chinese-English corpus.The results from the experiment proves that the fertility hidden Markov model  runs faster and has lower AER than the HMM. Their model is thus much faster and easier to understand than IBM Model 4.While better word alignment results do not necessarily correspond to better translation quality,their translation results are comparable in translation quality to both the HMM and IBM Model 4.
