The extensive use of Multiword Expressions (MWE) in natural language texts aims for a more adequate treatment of these expressions. A MWE typically expresses concepts and ideas that usually cannot be expressed by a single word. The aim of the paper is to apply techniques for the automatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to index them as a single unit. The motivation of the work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous and each of the different classes has specific characteristics, posing a challenge to the implementation of mechanisms that provide unified treatment for them. In terms of practical MWE identification systems, a well known approach is that of Smadja (1993), who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in corpora. This approach is implemented in a lexicographic tool called Xtract. More recently there has been the release of the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010) for the automatic extraction of MWEs from monolingual corpora, that both generates and validates MWE candidates. There were several experiments carried out in MWE. The MWEs insertion improves the results of retrieval for relevant documents, because the indexing of specific terms makes it easier to retrieve specific documents related to these terms. Nevertheless, the use of these expressions made the results worse in some cases, because some topics require a semantic analysis to return relevant documents. Some of these documents are related to the query, but do not satisfy all criteria in the query topic. We conclude also that the quality of MWEs used directly influenced the results.
