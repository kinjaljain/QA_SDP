The Wall Street Journal archives, for example, consist of a series of articles about different subject areas. Segmenting such data into distinct topics is useful for information retrieval, where only those segments relevant to a user&apos;s query can be retrieved. Another approach extracted semantic information from Roget&apos;s Thesaurus (RT). Lexical cohesion is expressed through the vocabulary used in text and the semantic relations between those words. Identifying semantic relations in a text can be a useful indicator of its conceptual structure. Reiteration is subdivided into four cohesive effects: word repetition (e.g. ascent and ascent), synonym (e.g. ascent and climb) which includes near-synonym and hyponym, superordinate (e.g. ascent and task) and general word (e.g. ascent and thing). To automatically detect lexical cohesion tics between pairwise words, three linguistic features were considered: word repetition, collocation and relation weights. Word repetition is a component of the lexical cohesion class of reiteration, and collocation is a lexical cohesion class in its entirety. Word repetition: Word repetition ties in lexical cohesion are identified by same word matches and matches on inflections derived from the same stem. The proposed segmentation algorithm compares adjacent windows of sentences and determines their lexical similarity. Both word repetition in combination with collocation and all three features in combination also achieved a precision rate of 0.80 but attained a lower recall rate of 0.62. The combination of features word repetition and relation weights produced the best precision and recall rates of 0.80 and 0.69. When used in isolation, the performance of each feature was inferior to a combined approach. This fact provides evidence that different lexical relations are detected by each linguistic feature considered.
