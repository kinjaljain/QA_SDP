Identification and Treatment of Multiword Expressions applied to Information Retrieval The extensive use of Multiword Expressions (MWE) in natural language texts prompts more detailed studies that aim for a more adequate treatment of these expressions. A MWE typically expresses concepts and ideas that usually cannot be expressed by a single word. Intuitively, with the appropriate treatment of MWEs, the results of an Information Retrieval (IR) system could be improved. The aim of this paper is to apply techniques for the automatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to index them as a single unit. Experimental results show improvements on the retrieval of relevant documents when identifying MWEs and treating them as a single indexing unit.

A MWE typically expresses concepts and ideas that usually cannot be expressed by a single word. The aim of the paper is to apply techniques for the automatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to index them as a single unit. The motivation of the work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous and each of the different classes has specific characteristics, posing a challenge to the implementation of mechanisms that provide unified treatment for them. In terms of practical MWE identification systems, a well known approach is that of Smadja (1993), who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in corpora. This approach is implemented in a lexicographic tool called Xtract. More recently there has been the release of the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010) for the automatic extraction of MWEs from monolingual corpora, that both generates and validates MWE candidates. There were several experiments carried out in MWE. The MWEs insertion improves the results of retrieval for relevant documents, because the indexing of specific terms makes it easier to retrieve specific documents related to these terms. Nevertheless, the use of these expressions made the results worse in some cases, because some topics require a semantic analysis to return relevant documents. Some of these documents are related to the query, but do not satisfy all criteria in the query topic. We conclude also that the quality of MWEs used directly influenced the results. The extensive use of Multiword Expressions (MWE) in natural language texts prompts more detailed studies that aim for a more adequate treatment of these expressions. The automatic discovery of specific types of MWEs has attracted the attention of many researchers in NLP over the past years. One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. This task aimed to explore the contribution of the disambiguation of words to bilingual or monolingual IR. In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Although language processing is not vital to modern IR systems, it may be convenient (Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP techniques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for indexing as single units in the IR system. The selection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor for the quality of IR systems. For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would 101 Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World (MWE 2011), pages 101â€“109, Portland, Oregon, USA, 23 June 2011. We used Zettair to generate the ranked list of documents retrieved in response to each query. This work consists in investigating the impact of Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems, and whether a more adequate treatment for these expressions can bring possible improvements in the indexing these expressions.
