From the one side, Espresso is intended as a general-purpose system able to extract a wide variety of binary semantic relations, from the classical is-a and part-of relations, to more specific and domain oriented ones like chemical reactants in a chemistry domain and position succession in political texts. Manually building three lexico-syntactic patterns, Hearst sketched a bootstrapping algorithm to learn more patterns from instances, which has served as the model for most subsequent pattern-based algorithms.</S Berland and Charniak [1] propose a system for part-of relation extraction, based on the Hearst approach [12]. Seed instances are used to infer linguistic patterns that, in turn, are used to extract new instances, ranked according to various statistical measures. The approach gives good results on specific relations such as birthdates, however it has low precision on generic ones like is-a and part-of. Other pattern-based algorithms include Riloff and Shepherd [21], who used a semiautomatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples by using pattern-based techniques and human supervision, KnowItAll [7] that performs large-scale extraction of facts from the Web, Mann [15] and Fleischman et al. [9] who used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of is-a relations involving proper nouns, and Downey et al. [6] who formalized the problem of relation extraction in a coherent and effective combinatorial model that is shown to outperform previous probabilistic frameworks. We adopt a slightly modified version of the term definition given in [13], as it is one of the most commonly used in the literature: ((Adj|Noun)+|((Adj|Noun)*(NounPrep)?)(Adj|Noun)*)Noun We operationally extend the definition of Adj to include present and past participles as most noun phrases composed of them are usually intended as terms (e.g., boiling point). The recall of a pattern p can be approximated by the fraction of input instances in I&apos; that are extracted by p. Since it is difficult at run-time to estimate the precision of a pattern, we are weary of keeping patterns that generate many instances (i.e., patterns that generate high recall but potentially disastrous precision). Semantic Relations Espresso is designed to extract various semantic relations exemplified by a given small set of seed instances. For our preliminary evaluation, we consider the standard is-a and part-of relations as well as three novel relations: succession: This relation indicates that one proper noun succeeds another in a position or title. For example, George Bush succeeded Bill Clinton and Pope Benedict XVI succeeded Pope John Paul II. We evaluate this relation on the TREC9 corpus. reaction: This relation occurs between chemical elements/molecules that can be combined in a chemical reaction. For example, hydrogen gas reacts-with oxygen gas and zinc reacts-with hydrochloric acid. We evaluate this relation on the CHEM corpus. production: This relation occurs when a process or element/object produces a result. For example, ammonia produces nitric oxide. We evaluate this relation on the CHEM corpus. We proposed a weakly supervised bootstrapping algorithm, called Espresso, for automatically extracting a wide variety of binary semantic relations from raw text.
