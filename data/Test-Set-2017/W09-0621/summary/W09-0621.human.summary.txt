This paper talks about Clustering and matching headlines for automatic paraphrase acquisition. For this purpose it is necessary to have a monolingual corpus of aligned paraphrased sentences. We compare two methods of aligning headlines to construct such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one based on clustering, and the other on pair wise similarity-based matching. News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News. It is clear that k-means clustering performs well when all unclustered headlines are artificially ignored. In the more realistic case when there are also items that cannot be clustered, the pair wise calculation of similarity with a back off strategy of using context performs better when we aim for higher precision.
