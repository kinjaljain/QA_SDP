<S sid="0">Clustering and Matching Headlines for Automatic Paraphrase Acquisition</S> For developing a data-driven text rewriting algorithm for paraphrasing, it is essential to have a monolingual corpus of aligned paraphrased sentences. News article headlines are a rich source of paraphrases; they tend to describe the same event in various different ways, and can easily be obtained from the web. We compare two methods of aligning headlines to construct such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one based on clustering, and the other on pairwise similarity-based matching. We show that the latter performs best on the task of aligning paraphrastic headlines. This paper talks about Clustering and matching headlines for automatic paraphrase acquisition. For this purpose it is necessary to have a monolingual corpus of aligned paraphrased sentences. We compare two methods of aligning headlines to construct such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one based on clustering, and the other on pair wise similarity-based matching. News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News. It is clear that k-means clustering performs well when all unclustered headlines are artificially ignored. In the more realistic case when there are also items that cannot be clustered, the pair wise calculation of similarity with a back off strategy of using context performs better when we aim for higher precision. For developing a data-driven text rewriting algorithm for paraphrasing, it is essential to have a monolingual corpus of aligned paraphrased sentences. We compare two methods of aligning headlines to construct such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one based on clustering, and the other on pairwise similarity-based matching. Therefore, paraphrase acquisition can be considered an important technology for producing resources for text-to-text generation. News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News. Our first approach is to use a clustering algorithm to cluster similar headlines. The k-means algorithm is an algorithm that assigns k centers to represent the clustering of n points (k &lt; n) in a vector space. We use these annotated clusters as development and test data in developing a method to automatically obtain paraphrase pairs from headline clusters. We use an Fβ -score with a β of 0.25 as we favour precision over recall. For each original cluster, k-means clustering is then performed using the k found by the cluster stopping function. With this in mind, we adopt two thresholds and the Cosine similarity function to calculate the similarity between two sentences: cos(θ) = V 1 · V 2 V 1 V 2 where V 1 and V 2 are the vectors of the two sentences being compared. It is clear that k-means clustering performs well when all unclustered headlines are artificially ignored.
