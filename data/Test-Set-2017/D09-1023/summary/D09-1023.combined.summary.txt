Feature-Rich Translation by Quasi-Synchronous Lattice Parsing We present a machine translation framework that can incorporate arbitrary features of both input and output sentences. The core of the approach is a novel decoder based on lattice parsing with quasi- synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006), a syntactic formalism that does not require source and target trees to be isomorphic. Using generic approximate dynamic programming techniques, this decoder can handle “non-local” features. Similar approximate inference techniques support efficient parameter estimation with hidden variables. We use the decoder to conduct controlled experiments on a German-to-English translation task, to compare lexical phrase, syntax, and combined models, and to measure effects of various restrictions on non- isomorphism. This paper describes Gimpel and Smith’s novel decoder. It is based on efficient DP-based QG lattice parsing extended to handle non-local features using generic techniques that also support efficient parameter estimation. They used one feature for each of the configurations in (Smith and Eisner, 2006), adding 7 additional features and presented a machine translation framework that could incorporate arbitrary features of both input and output sentences. Their findings showed that phrase features and dependency syntax produce complementary improvements to translation quality, that tree-to- tree configurations were helpful for translation, and that substantial gains could be obtained by permitting certain types of non- isomorphism. Their decoding framework allowed them to perform many experiments with the same feature representation and inference algorithms, including combining and comparing phrase-based and syntax-based features and examining how isomorphism constraints of synchronous formalisms affect translation output.

We present a machine translation framework that can incorporate arbitrary features of both input and output sentences. Here we take first steps toward such a universal decoder, making the following contributions:Arbitrary feature model (Â§2): We define a sin gle, direct log-linear translation model (Papineni et al., 1997; Och and Ney, 2002) that encodes most popular MT features and can be used to encode any features on source and target sentences, dependency trees, and alignments. We compare lexical phrase and dependency syntax features, as well as a novel com 2 To date, QG has been used for word alignment (Smith and Eisner, 2006), adaptation and projection in parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2009), and various monolingual recognition and scoring tasks (Wang et al., 2007; Das and Smith, 2009); this paper represents its first application to MT. 219 Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 219–228, Singapore, 67 August 2009. Figure 1: Decoding as lattice parsing, with the highest-scoring translation denoted by black lattice arcs (others are grayed out) and thicker blue arcs forming a dependency tree over them. Our decoding framework allows us to perform many experiments with the same feature representation and inference algorithms, including combining and comparing phrase-based and syntax-based features and examining how isomorphism constraints of synchronous formalisms affect translation output.

Our findings show that phrase features and dependency syntax produce complementary improvements to translation quality, that tree-to- tree configurations (a new feature in MT) are helpful for translation, and that substantial gains can be obtained by permitting certain types of non- isomorphism.
