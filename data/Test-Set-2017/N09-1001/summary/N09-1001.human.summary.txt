Fangzhong Su and Katja Markert in their paper 'Subjectivity Recognition on Word Senses via Semi-supervised Mincuts' proposes the approach for supplementing WordNet entries with infor- mation on the subjectivity of its word senses.They propose a semi-supervised minimum cut framework that makes use of both WordNet definitions and its relation structure.They  deal with classification at the word sense level,including subjectivity-ambiguous words.the main idea is binary classification with minimum cuts (Mincuts) in graphs which is based on the idea that similar items should be grouped in the same cut.The formulation of semi-supervised Mincut for sense subjectivity classification involves the steps:Selection of unlabeled data,Weighting of edges to the classification vertices and Assigning weights to WordNet relations.Their best result from Mincuts is 84.6%.
