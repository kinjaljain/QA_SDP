This paper talks about 11,001 New Features for Statistical Machine Translation. For this they use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm of Crammer et al. to add a large number of new features to two machine translation systems: the Hiero hierarchical phrase-based translation system and a syntax-based translation system. We add more than 250 features to improve a syntax-based MT system—already the highest-scoring single system in the NIST 2008 Chinese-English common-data track—by +1.1 Bleu. They also add more than 10,000 features to Hiero (Chiang, 2005) and obtain a +1.5 Bleu improvement. These features are discriminatively trained using MIRA, and led to significant improvements. The authors also provide a closer look at the results to see how the new features qualitatively improved translation quality.
