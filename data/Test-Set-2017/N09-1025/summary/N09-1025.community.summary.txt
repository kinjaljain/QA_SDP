We add more than 250 features to improve a syntax- based MT system—already the highest-scoring single system in the NIST 2008 ChineseEnglish common-data track—by +1.1 B. We also add more than 10,000 features to Hiero (Chiang, 2005) and obtain a +1.5 B improvement. Our results add to a growing body of evidence (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) that MIRA is preferable to MERT across languages and systems, even for very large-scale tasks. Another line of research (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) tries to squeeze as many features as possible from a relatively small dataset. Hiero (Chiang, 2005) is a hierarchical, string-to- string translation system. Two of the features are n-gram language models, which require intersecting the synchronous CFG with finite-state automata representing the language models. This grammar can be parsed efficiently using cube pruning (Chiang, 2007). We incorporate all our new features into a linear model (Och and Ney, 2002) and train them using MIRA (Crammer et al., 2006), following previous work (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008). Following Chiang et al. (2008), we calculate the sentence B scores in (1), (2), and (3) in the context of some previous 1-best translations.
