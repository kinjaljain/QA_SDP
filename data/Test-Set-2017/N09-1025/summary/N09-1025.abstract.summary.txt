11,001 New Features for Statistical Machine Translation We use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm of Crammer et al. to add a large number of new features to two machine translation systems: the Hiero hierarchical phrase- based translation system and our syntax-based translation system. On a large-scale ChineseEnglish translation task, we obtain statistically significant improvements of +1.5 B and+1.1 B, respectively. We analyze the impact of the new features and the performance of the learning algorithm.
